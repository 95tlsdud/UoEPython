Firstly `arange()` is a function from `numpy` that works a little like the `range()` function does for integers, but producing something similar using floating point numbers. Once again it takes three arguments, start, stop and step length. Next `plot()` which is part of a module called `matplotlib`, this plots a line through some points specified in two arguments to the function as `x` and `y` coordinates. Lastly the function `show()` displays the plot that has been created.\n",
